The workload is not too insane but definitely not too chill either. Some people can do it but if you do this combo, then all of your other courses should be chill enough and you shouldn't be taking any other CS courses other than these.",

To my knowledge, 579 is not available on the fall, unless it got added this week. 559 is really easy if you take sifakis’ section. I loved that class and it’s minimal workload. CS advisors recommend taking one of your beyond calc 2 math classes, so you could take 340. I took 577 and 340 the same semester.",
