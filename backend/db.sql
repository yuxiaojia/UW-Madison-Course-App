In-depth studies and discussions of classic and contemporary ethnographies in multiple Asian contexts that focus on themes like religion, health, economics, and sexuality in writing, photography, and film at once illustrate various methods involved in doing ethnography and illuminate why scholars have for decades studied and represented Asia through ethnography. The methods of ethnography are never divorced from the motivations of the scholars, and thus it is crucial to probe critically and collectively what ethnography is (theory), how it is done (practice), and why is it worth doing generally and in Asian contexts in particular.','Requisites: Senior standing'),(49447,'LITERARY STUDIES IN CHINESE DRAMA','Asian Languages and Cultures','ASIAN 671','3 credits','An in-depth study of selected texts of and about traditional Chinese drama, from the Yuan dynasty through the twentieth century.

From marriage licenses, passports, and don\'t ask, don\'t tell policies to literacy requirements and gag rules, written texts have played major roles in enforcing expectations about race and sex in the United States. At the same time, anti-slavery petitions, letters to the editor, wheat-pasted posters, and hashtag activism all also harness the power of writing to challenge and revise those expectations. In light of that active textual production and negotiation, this class traces public debates and daily experiences where people write or talk about race and sex in order to make a difference. Ultimately, the class takes on the power of words to break bones and heal wounds. Through reading and writing informed by scholarship in writing studies and rhetoric, students in this class will examine historical and contemporary interconnections among race, sexuality, gender, and texts in the United States, developing analytical tools for understanding how language works on and in their world.','Requisites: Sophomore standing'),(52159,'SEMINAR ON TUTORING WRITING ACROSS THE CURRICULUM','English','ENGL 403','3 credits','Explores current theory and research on the writing process and analyzes disciplinary genres and conventions.

From the microbes that inhabit our guts to political revolutions sparked by a tweet, human lives are embedded in an ecology of complex, interdependent systems. Using the lens of Human Ecology, you will address \"big questions\" like: How am I connected to others and to larger systems? What brings happiness and works for the \"greater good\" in human lives? An overarching goal of the course is to help you understand yourself as embedded in the web of ever-evolving interconnected networks, an \"EcoYou.\" Human Ecology is a systems approach to studying and understanding relationships between humans and their everyday environments; it is a civic and socially conscious orientation that is committed to understanding and improving the quality of human lives. Human Ecology is inherently interdisciplinary drawing on research, theories and methods from diverse fields such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, public health, biology, and art and design.','Requisites: None'),(54172,'SOHE CAREER & LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT','Interdisciplinary Courses','INTER-HE 202','1 credit','Provides an introduction to leadership development, career development and career readiness competencies for students in the School of Human Ecology.','Requisites: None'),(54173,'SPECIAL TOPICS IN HUMAN ECOLOGY','Interdisciplinary Courses','INTER-HE 301','1-3 credits','Special Topics in Human Ecology for undergraduate students.
